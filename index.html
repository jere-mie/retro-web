        <h3>A little about this project</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>this is a simple repository containing small websites and projects I make in an effort to bring back the old spirit of just putting something out
            there on the web, or just making something fun/interesting. The idea started out when I thought of making some simple, dumb 'love calculator'
            website using basic javascript, and I thought why not make an entire repo dedicated to little, fun things like this.
            <br>
            The objective of this is not to make anything too serious or anything that looks good, but rather to bring back the old magic of having
            your own corner of the internet that you made yourself.
        </p>
